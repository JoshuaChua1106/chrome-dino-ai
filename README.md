# Project Overview
This is a Chrome Dino Game AI built using Python, Pygame, and the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. 

The project recreates the classic offline dinosaur jumping game and trains neural networks to play it autonomously. The AI receives four sensor inputs: dino height, distance to the nearest obstacle, obstacle height,
and current game speed. 

Through evolutionary learning, populations of 10 AI players compete over multiple generations, with fitness scores based on survival time, speed adaptation, obstacles cleared, and jump efficiency (with penalties for unnecessary jumps). The system evolves increasingly sophisticated jumping behaviors,
learning to time jumps precisely to avoid cacti while minimizing wasteful actions.#
